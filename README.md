#Game description 
CREATE A LINKER GAME IN THE STYLE OF JELLY SPLASH OR BEST FIENDS

#GAME MECHANICS
The board consists of at least 5 different coloured tiles and may be of various sizes (5x5, 7x7, 6x9 etc.)
Adjacent tiles of the same colour can be linked
Tiles can be linked horizontally, vertically or diagonally
At least 3 tiles in a link are required to make a match
Matched tiles are removed from the board
The board collapses downward to fill empty slots and new tiles fall in from the top
The board reshuffles the tiles if there are no valid links available to make
The link in progress can be undone by swiping back to the previous tile


#Featires:
Goal-based levels (e.g. earn a certain number of points, completing within a certain number of moves etc.)
At least 2 levels to play
A Unity Editor-based level creator to make updates without code changes
A main menu and level selection screen with navigation between them
Unity Editor data hooks to easily manipulate the game and feeling, e.g. animation curves. Imagine that game designers, artists and level designers will continue working on your game post-submission
Well-structured, scalable code that adheres to best practices. Extensive documentation is not required, but comments should be added where appropriate. Imagine that other developers will continue working on your game post-submission
